Connection forwarding library.

Its functionality is similar to ssh tunneling except that it forwards
connectionless UDP as well, by creating local + remote UDP socket pairs
for each remote datagram source on the listening side.

Note that the forwarding protocol provides no encryption, authentication
or any other security features by itself. All that is the responsibility
of the transport layer (i.e. the underlying GIOStream).
